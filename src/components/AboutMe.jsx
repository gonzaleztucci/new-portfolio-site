       <Bio>
        <p>
            I'm a Full Stack Web Developer based in Valencia, Spain.
            After working as a Buyer for Automotive, Tech and Green Energies companies
            for nearly 10 years I gave a spin to my career to start working full time
            as a Full Stack Engineer.
        </p>
          <br/>
        <p>
        In 2022 I joined <a href="https://cohelion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cohelion</a> as a Junior Software Developer, 
        which has not only allowed me to gain technical expertise in data manipulation, 
        analysis, and visualization, but also invaluable experience in remotely 
        collaborating with cross functional teams, code debugging and adhering to best coding practices. 
        This has been a great place to enhance my overall software development skills, 
        contributing to a strong foundation for my future career.

        </p>
          <br/>
        <p>
        During this period Iâ€™ve been learning and working mainly in Coldfusion and SQL Server, 
        but I also have strong knowledge of Node.js and have experience building REST APIs with Express coupled with PostgreSQL. 
        For the Front End I work mostly with React and libraries such as Redux and React Bootstrap and styled components.
        </p>
          <br/>
        <p>
          On top of my Systems Engineering degree, in regards of Web Development,
          I've trained myself mostly with <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Codecademy's Full-Stack Software Engineer career path</a>,  
            which includes training on important aspects such as:
